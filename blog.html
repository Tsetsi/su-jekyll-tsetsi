                    We pride ourselves for how perfect our roasted potatoes are. We truly though they couldn't get be better, but it turns out the air fryer works some kind of magic on potatoes. They get extra crispy all over and stay perfectly soft on the inside. Toss them in just a little bit of oil so all of the seasonings stick to make these the most addicting potatoes ever. They are by far one of our favorite air fryer recipes to date.

                         Indian food may be known for that slow-cooked flavor, but that doesn't mean it has to take forever to make. From spicy curries to rice bowls, your favorite Indian dishes just got a whole lot easier to make thanks to your Instant Pot.

                              Excited to return to Lummi Island with Gentl & Hyers this August 18-21. They will be teaching a photography workshop with a focus on reportage, food, still life and portraits. My friend Jim Henkens and I will be supporting them with our experience in food styling, photography and prop sourcing. The workshop will be hosted at Jimâ€™s beautiful and quaint beach cottage that is full of vintage kitchenware.
