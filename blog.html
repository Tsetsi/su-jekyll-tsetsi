                    We pride ourselves for how perfect our roasted potatoes are. We truly though they couldn't get be better, but it turns out the air fryer works some kind of magic on potatoes. They get extra crispy all over and stay perfectly soft on the inside. Toss them in just a little bit of oil so all of the seasonings stick to make these the most addicting potatoes ever. They are by far one of our favorite air fryer recipes to date.
