         <h2>About Jade</h2>
         <p class="about-content">
              Welcome! I’m Jade – cookbook author, photographer, homesteader, plant nerd, and educator extraordinaire! I’m so happy to have you here in my home on the web.
         </p>
         <p class="about-content">
                Likes: the smell of tomato leaves, gardneing, my beagle’s muzzle, scinece, sticking cold hands under a warm faucet, the first produce of the season, Sansa Stark, and true crime podcasts.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
                Dislikes: ghosting, ants, the smell of broccoli cooking, carpeted airports, wastefulness, when you walk on a surface that makes your shoes sound SUPER squeaky, #notallmen, and sesame seeds.
